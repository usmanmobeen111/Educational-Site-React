# TODO for Improving Testimonials Component

- [x] Update Testimonials.jsx to include a card-based layout using Tailwind CSS classes and custom colors from index.css (primary, secondary, tertiary).
- [x] Replace rating text with star icons from react-icons (use AiFillStar for filled stars and AiOutlineStar for empty stars).
- [x] Implement a star rating display function that shows full stars based on the integer part of the rating.
- [x] Add responsive grid layout for testimonials cards.
- [x] Style cards with background, borders, shadows, and hover effects to make it visually appealing.
- [ ] Test the component by running the development server and verifying the layout and star ratings.
